# Qubership Istio

A Qubership-packaged distribution of [Istio Ambient Mesh](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ambient/).

This repository provides an umbrella Helm chart that installs the full Istio Ambient Mesh stack (`base`, `cni`, `istiod`, `ztunnel`) with Qubership-specific registry override support, optional Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, and a transfer Docker image for platform delivery.

## Components

| Subchart | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `base` | CRDs and cluster-scoped base resources |
| `cni` | Istio CNI DaemonSet |
| `istiod` | Control plane (Pilot) |
| `ztunnel` | Ambient L4 data plane (DaemonSet) |

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Kubernetes 1.31–1.35, Helm 3.6+, Gateway API CRDs pre-installed, `cluster-admin` privileges.

```bash
helm dependency build helm-templates/qubership-istio
helm upgrade --install qubership-istio helm-templates/qubership-istio \
  --namespace istio-system --create-namespace
```

Install in `istio-system` only — one instance per cluster.

**Enroll a namespace into the ambient mesh:**

```bash
kubectl label namespace <your-ns> \
  istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient \
  istio.io/use-waypoint=waypoint
```

Restart existing workloads after labeling.

## Key Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `global.profile` | `ambient` | Mesh profile |
| `global.hub` / `tag` | — | Image registry override |
| `MONITORING_ENABLED` | `true` | Deploy ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, GrafanaDashboards |
| `monitoring.scrapeInterval` | `15s` | Prometheus scrape interval |
| `istiod.*`, `ztunnel.*`, `cni.*` | see `values.yaml` | Pass any upstream Istio values under the subchart key |

> When this chart is used as a sub-dependency of a parent chart, prefix all values with `qubership-istio.`

## Monitoring

When `MONITORING_ENABLED=true` (default), the chart deploys:
- `ServiceMonitor` for istiod
- `PodMonitor` for ztunnel
- Two Grafana dashboards (control plane + ztunnel) via `GrafanaDashboard` CRs

## Transfer Image

A scratch Docker image (`qubership-istio-transfer`) is built and pushed to `ghcr.io` by CI. It embeds the packaged Helm chart for platform delivery.

| Build                                          | Image tags | Chart `version` |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Release from the default branch                | `1.0.2`, `1.0`, `latest`, `1.0.2-istio1.30.2` | `1.0.2` |
| Release from a support branch                  | `1.0.2`, `1.0`, `1.0.2-istio1.30.2` — no `latest` | `1.0.2` |
| Branch push                                    | `<branch-slug>` | `0.0.0-<branch-slug>` |
| Pull request from a fork, or a renovate branch | none (dry run) | — |

Branch tags expire after 7 days; [the weekly cleanup job](.github/workflows/cleanup-old-docker-container.yml) keeps `latest` and every version-shaped tag.

## Versioning and Releases

qubership-istio carries its own SemVer, independent of the Istio version it bundles. The bundled Istio version stays visible through the `-istio<version>` image alias and the vendored subchart versions in `Chart.lock`.

An Istio bump moves the matching part of the qubership-istio version:

| Change | Version bump |
|--------|-------------|
| Istio major (`1.x` → `2.x`) | major |
| Istio minor (`1.30` → `1.31`) | minor |
| Istio patch (`1.30.1` → `1.30.2`) | patch |
| `feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | major |
| `feat:` | minor |
| `fix:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, anything else | patch |

To cut a release, run the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) from the Actions tab. The `branch` input picks what gets released — `main` by default — independently of the branch the workflow is dispatched on; its head commit is resolved once and every later job pins that SHA.

The default `auto` version type reads both signals since the previous tag — the Istio chart dependency in `Chart.yaml`, and the conventional-commit prefixes of the commits — and takes the stronger one. So an Istio patch bump landing alongside a `feat:` gives a minor release. Pick `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or `explicit` to override it.

A branch with no commits since its last release is rejected — there is nothing new to ship, and tagging the same commit twice is what leaves one commit carrying two versions and an ambiguous baseline for anything branched from it.

The workflow tags the commit `<version>`, runs the full build and integration matrix, publishes the image, and creates the GitHub release page with notes drafted from the merged pull requests. A failed build or a failed publish removes the tag it was cut for. Use `dry-run` to resolve the version and run the build without touching tags, the registry, or the release page. `skip-tests` drops the integration matrix, which cuts most of the wall time off a rehearsal — on a real release it means publishing an image no cluster has run, so the run logs a warning and the job summary records it.

Release notes are grouped by pull request label — `breaking-change`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `bug`, `fix`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `documentation`, `dependencies`, `maintenance`. Renovate labels its Istio pull requests with `dependencies`.

### Long-term support lines

Only the default branch opens a new major or minor line. Any other branch is a maintenance line and moves the patch part alone — a release that would move more than that fails. That covers `major` and `minor`, an `auto` run whose signals resolve to either, and an `explicit` version that leaves the branch's `X.Y.x` line. A failed `auto` release there means a `feat:` or a breaking change landed on the branch: either release it from the default branch, or keep such changes off the maintenance line.
